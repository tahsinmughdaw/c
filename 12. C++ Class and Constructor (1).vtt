00:01.760 --> 00:09.170
In the previous video I have shown you how to convert C language program to C++ program using a rectangle

00:09.170 --> 00:12.320
class not the same program or same class.

00:12.410 --> 00:17.080
I will try it once again freshly as a new c++ program.

00:17.570 --> 00:25.330
So let us write a class for a rectangle using C++ so here first of all we should include a header find

00:25.340 --> 00:31.570
that is your stream include I O stream

00:34.290 --> 00:39.800
it baby I use stream alright your stream dot actually depending on the compiler you are using and if

00:39.800 --> 00:47.780
you have to write some words I use stream lead then you have to see using namespace STV so that you

00:47.780 --> 00:53.660
can use the scene and see out objects for display or reading.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.740
I may or may not be using them but this is the team that you have to write on in the beginning.

00:57.740 --> 01:00.410
If you have seen NC out in your program.

01:00.410 --> 01:06.580
Now let us write a class for third time the class rectangle.

01:07.370 --> 01:09.980
Instead the class will still fall I need the data remember.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.470
So let us be clear there mass.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.350
Private.

01:12.350 --> 01:13.730
So I need to rate our members.

01:13.730 --> 01:14.890
One is Lent.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.880
And the second one is Brent.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.890
So this is integer bread.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.900
I'm taking both of them as integer.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.000
So if you want to change the data type you can change that.

01:25.380 --> 01:31.370
Then the next thing I would define member functions so I will write all of them inside public block.

01:31.520 --> 01:36.740
So the first thing we should have a construct of the constructor will not have any return type but it

01:36.740 --> 01:38.640
may take or may not take barometer.

01:38.640 --> 01:44.510
So first time writing No not a human constructor which doesn't make any argument so I should initialize

01:44.510 --> 01:50.480
lend but to some value so I will assign both land as well as but equal to 1.

01:50.810 --> 01:54.620
So this we can call it dies out before it got struck down.

01:54.740 --> 01:58.300
So I have written them in a single line because I need more space here.

01:58.430 --> 02:01.050
The next I will write on the bottom twice constructor.

02:01.070 --> 02:06.280
This will be called as constructor overloading the stakes limit.

02:06.350 --> 02:12.200
And also this I will be defining it outside using scope resolution operator.

02:12.830 --> 02:18.650
So this is just a prototype or a signature of a function of the header of a function.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.540
So does a constructor remember function.

02:21.660 --> 02:28.600
Now next up on the rectangle I may need the functions like calculating area of calculating betting meter.

02:28.700 --> 02:33.880
No next function I should have this idea function which should be done.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.480
That is integer type.

02:35.480 --> 02:43.340
Then one more integer Betty need a which returns burying me dead of a rectangle.

02:43.460 --> 02:46.090
Now these two type of functions I don't.

02:46.290 --> 02:50.790
If you want to have other functions like get a set of functions you can divide them.

02:50.990 --> 02:52.590
So I will show only for limit.

02:52.910 --> 02:54.840
And but you can add them.

02:55.110 --> 02:56.140
So only for Lent.

02:56.150 --> 03:02.350
I would have one function that is a get to lent get lent which will return.

03:02.390 --> 03:13.340
Let it so here it I will and expanded and then we'll see a return lent then the Lexus sector lender

03:13.490 --> 03:14.570
to change the land.

03:14.630 --> 03:19.460
So in the previous video I was calling and ask a chain to lend God let us set.

03:19.490 --> 03:26.010
Let it now set a land wide sect length function.

03:26.100 --> 03:30.020
Now this should be changed to lend to a new given length.

03:30.320 --> 03:35.010
So medically I was right in a single line because it has to just change the land.

03:35.080 --> 03:42.290
I'm changing land assign so these are the functions that I need and I don't have any district that I

03:42.290 --> 03:44.190
don't have to destroy anything.

03:44.300 --> 03:49.310
If you have to destroy anything and if you have any dynamic memory or location inside the constructor

03:49.730 --> 03:53.280
then you can release that memory inside a destructive.

03:53.330 --> 03:55.680
So how Destructor is written it is redundant.

03:55.790 --> 03:59.060
Just see using a class name but that symbol.

03:59.600 --> 04:05.480
So it should have a name that is correct tandem with the symbol and no arguments at all.

04:06.410 --> 04:11.370
So these are member functions of a rectangle class these two are constructors.

04:11.400 --> 04:16.080
These are all loaded constructor when that's default constructor that are what is bottom and trace on

04:16.130 --> 04:22.160
these type of functions which actually perform some operations on data and bits of an object we call

04:22.160 --> 04:23.950
them as facilitators.

04:24.230 --> 04:30.270
And then this is access that is get function or get out of function.

04:30.540 --> 04:34.040
And this is new data that is separate function.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.370
And this is a destructor.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.840
These type of functions are that.

04:39.020 --> 04:42.480
I haven't done all the type of function inside a class.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.060
Now this is already implemented.

04:45.230 --> 04:49.780
These three functions I have to implement them so I implement them outside the class.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.940
So after this I have great them.

04:51.990 --> 04:52.290
So.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.680
So here I relied on those functions.

04:54.680 --> 04:58.680
So let us write on the first function that is constructor product constructor.

04:58.940 --> 05:06.440
So here for implementation first of all I should write on the class name rectangle and scope resolution

05:06.560 --> 05:08.740
constructor name right.

05:09.050 --> 05:15.320
And it is sticking to by I mean does integer and an integer be integer lantern.

05:15.550 --> 05:17.050
And there is more return type.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.210
So identically starts from.

05:18.220 --> 05:18.420
Yeah.

05:18.710 --> 05:23.670
So the only thing I have to do is let it assign and assign B.

05:23.690 --> 05:28.910
So for all you have any validations you can do them here checking for the lender's value don't know

05:28.910 --> 05:36.140
about this that is not a next function as ADR functions so I will write on implementation of the body

05:36.140 --> 05:37.250
of that function.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.450
This is the return type.

05:38.570 --> 05:43.810
Then the last name rectangle and scope resolution the function name is ADR.

05:43.940 --> 05:47.450
It doesn't take any argument so it's also a single line function.

05:47.450 --> 05:53.030
So just I will say it on land and go back.

05:55.450 --> 06:02.740
Now next function is a body to function so I will implement it on site and rectangle of the class name.

06:02.750 --> 06:07.100
So I have to use the scoop resolution because this function is not our independent function.

06:07.100 --> 06:13.870
This is a part of our rectangle class so function they must bury me to bury me.

06:13.970 --> 06:17.290
It doesn't make any argument and it's also simple form a line.

06:17.290 --> 06:23.970
A single line function so just set it on to in to lend less bread.

06:24.290 --> 06:26.680
So that's the end of a function.

06:26.690 --> 06:33.110
Now the last function that is a destructor though I don't have anything to be a look at here if at all

06:33.110 --> 06:38.900
any deal should look glad you can do that inside destructor and you can implement by district a district

06:38.900 --> 06:46.440
that will not have any different types so identically a class name and scooped resolution and decides.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.990
So instead the district.

06:48.990 --> 06:51.590
I don't have anything to do so I'll just leave it blank.

06:52.980 --> 06:53.690
That's all.

06:53.810 --> 06:58.950
These are the functions I have implemented them using scope resolution outside the class.

06:59.030 --> 07:02.720
No I relied on the main function and use these functions.

07:02.870 --> 07:12.530
Let us write the main function here and main not the first thing I create an object of rectangle C rectangle

07:13.190 --> 07:16.960
are 10 and file length and breadth.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.910
So this will create a rectangle with land.

07:20.020 --> 07:23.790
And that fine the next I will call the function.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.060
So I need a function that is aiding and bury me that I can call them.

07:27.170 --> 07:33.500
I never identically displayed errors and so C on and on ADR.

07:33.650 --> 07:40.680
This sort of display area C out of dog reading meter.

07:41.690 --> 07:50.420
This will display many meter if I want to change the length I can see set land function I can call on

07:50.460 --> 07:53.270
I haven't changed the length to brandy.

07:53.380 --> 07:59.630
Now if I wanted to display the length then I can see see out on the dot get lent

08:02.230 --> 08:03.650
lent to it'll be displayed.

08:03.650 --> 08:07.200
This function will return to the land and sea org where displayed.

08:08.210 --> 08:10.470
So this is the end of the main function.

08:10.530 --> 08:12.410
Now once the main function ends.

08:12.410 --> 08:17.780
This is a district that will be automatically guarded because the object is going outside the scope

08:17.980 --> 08:19.020
functions.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.320
So a district that will be called because the object will be destroyed.

08:23.270 --> 08:30.020
So this is a fresh C++ class I have written right from the beginning I have done everything so in the

08:30.020 --> 08:31.890
previous year I have converted.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.010
Not in this video I have facility on it now in my course at very few places I have written C++ scored

08:39.050 --> 08:43.840
because most of the time I haven't done C language good and when I have finished the topic of data structure

08:43.850 --> 08:46.950
like for example it is a battle of the topic of furries.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.640
I have read on the C++ class for us the linguists at the end of the topic I have read in the class for

08:53.300 --> 08:58.410
linguists that a C++ class for linguists so I have collected all the operations of a linguist and I

08:58.430 --> 09:04.040
have put them in a single class and have defined it as a class each and every function I have discussed

09:04.040 --> 09:10.430
them separately just like C language program because if you see in this example if I have to discuss

09:10.510 --> 09:16.820
ADR for rectangle then I have to discuss only a function like that is the function audio of erectile

09:16.820 --> 09:20.200
dysfunction I have to discuss I don't have to do this because I am not a class.

09:20.480 --> 09:26.140
So like this insertion in linguists so I have discussed this separately and have discussed only a function

09:26.460 --> 09:28.780
the later I have converted into a glass.

09:28.820 --> 09:31.630
So I've been off the topic so you'll find C++ code.

09:31.760 --> 09:37.160
So there sometimes I have converted to C language code to C++ and sometimes I have freshly hit on a

09:37.160 --> 09:38.120
class like this.

09:38.630 --> 09:42.890
So now you're familiar with this one so you can easily follow the rest of the course.

09:42.980 --> 09:46.190
So hope you get a lot of benefit from this course.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.700
So one more thing I have to show you that is endless.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.890
How do you stimulate out templates.

09:50.940 --> 09:52.520
And this goes back in the next video.
